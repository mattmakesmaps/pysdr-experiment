## Chapter 02

- Amplitude: Indicates the “strength” of the wave. [REF](https://pysdr.org/content/frequency_domain.html#fourier-transform)

- Frequency: The number of waves per second. [REF](https://pysdr.org/content/frequency_domain.html#fourier-transform)

- Phase represents how the sine wave is shifted in time, anywhere from 0 to 360 degrees (or 0 to 2\pi), but it must be relative to something to have any meaning, such as two signals with the same frequency being 30 degrees out of phase with each other. [REF](https://pysdr.org/content/frequency_domain.html#fourier-transform)

- Fourier Transform: The mathematical transform used to convert from the time domain to the frequency domain. [REF](https://pysdr.org/content/frequency_domain.html#fourier-transform)

## Chapter 03

- Nyquist Rate: The minimum rate at which we can sample. The minimum rate at which a (finite bandwidth) signal needs to be sampled to retain all of its information. [REF](https://pysdr.org/content/sampling.html#nyquist-sampling)
